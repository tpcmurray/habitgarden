  "first_steps": [
    "The first few days aren't about building the habit — they're about building the identity of someone who does this. You're not 'trying to read more.' You're a reader now.",
    "Research from UCL found the average time to form a habit is 66 days, but the range is huge — 18 to 254 days. Don't measure yourself against a magic number. Just keep showing up.",
    "The most effective strategy for new habits is called 'habit stacking' — attach your new habit to something you already do. 'After I pour my coffee, I read for 10 minutes.' The existing habit becomes the trigger.",
    "BJ Fogg's research at Stanford shows that making a habit tiny is more effective than relying on motivation. If your goal feels hard today, do the smallest possible version. One page. One minute. It counts.",
    "Your brain hasn't built the neural pathway for this yet. Right now, doing this habit requires active decision-making. In a few weeks, it'll start to feel automatic. The hard part is right now.",
    "Environment design beats willpower every time. Want to read more? Put the book on your pillow. Want to stop snacking? Move the snacks out of sight. Make the right choice the easy choice.",
    "James Clear calls it the 'two-minute rule' — when you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do. The point isn't the activity. The point is showing up consistently.",
    "You're in the 'initiation phase' right now. Research shows this is when conscious effort is highest. It gets easier — not because the habit changes, but because your brain starts automating it."
  ],
  "building_momentum": [
    "You're past the first few days. That matters more than you think — most people who attempt a new habit don't make it past day 3.",
    "Your brain is starting to build the neural pathway now. Each repetition strengthens it. Think of it like a path through tall grass — the more you walk it, the clearer it gets.",
    "Motivation is unreliable. What you're building right now is something better: a routine. Routines don't need motivation. They run on momentum.",
    "Research shows that the context — same time, same place, same preceding action — matters as much as the habit itself. Your brain is learning the pattern, not just the behavior.",
    "If you're finding some days harder than others, that's normal. Habit strength isn't linear. It's more like a stock market — volatile day to day, trending upward over time.",
    "Don't optimize yet. Don't try to read more pages, run farther, or meditate longer. Just keep the streak alive. Volume comes after consistency.",
    "You're in what researchers call the 'learning phase.' Your brain is associating cue → routine → reward. The reward matters — notice how it feels after you complete this habit.",
    "Social accountability increases habit adherence by 65% in some studies. Even just telling one person what you're working on can help."
  ],
  "streak_broken": [
    "A broken streak feels like starting over. It's not. Research shows that missing once has almost no measurable impact on long-term habit formation. Missing twice is where it gets dangerous.",
    "Perfection isn't the goal — consistency is. And consistency includes recovery. The fact that you're here, seeing this message, means you haven't quit.",
    "There's a concept called 'abstinence violation effect' — the tendency to go all-in on failure after one slip. 'I already missed one day, why bother?' That's the real enemy, not the missed day.",
    "The best athletes in the world miss training sessions. The difference is they show up the next day. Your streak number reset. Your progress didn't.",
    "Ask yourself: what got in the way? Not to judge yourself, but to problem-solve. If the answer is 'I forgot,' that's an environment design problem. If it's 'I didn't feel like it,' that's a motivation design problem. Both are solvable.",
    "Research from Phillippa Lally at UCL found that a single missed day did not meaningfully affect the habit formation process. The trajectory stayed the same. One miss is noise, not signal.",
    "Your buddy doesn't know what a 'streak' is. It just knows you showed up today. That's all that matters right now.",
    "Here's what didn't reset: every neural pathway you've built, every time you chose this habit over the alternative, every day you showed up before today. That infrastructure is still there."
  ],
  "hitting_wall": [
    "This is the part nobody talks about — the messy middle. The novelty has worn off. The results haven't fully arrived yet. This is where most habits die. But it's also where real habits are made.",
    "If it's feeling like a chore, try reducing the scope temporarily. Half the time, half the effort. It's better to do a tiny version than to skip entirely.",
    "Discipline isn't a personality trait — it's a skill, and it fatigues like a muscle. If you're struggling, look at what else is draining your willpower right now. Sometimes the answer isn't 'try harder' — it's 'simplify everything else.'",
    "Research on 'ego depletion' suggests that self-control is a limited resource. If your days are full of hard decisions, you'll have less energy for your habits. Consider moving your habit to a time when you're freshest.",
    "Boredom is the biggest threat to habit maintenance, not difficulty. If the habit feels boring, that's actually a sign it's becoming automatic. The boredom is the pathway to permanence.",
    "This is a great time to revisit your 'why.' Not the surface reason — the deep one. You're not just reading 20 minutes a day. You're becoming someone who prioritizes learning. Reconnect with that.",
    "Consider adding a small reward immediately after the habit. Your brain needs the dopamine loop to close. The long-term benefits are too distant — give yourself something now too.",
    "You've been at this for weeks. That's not nothing — that's remarkable, statistically. Most people are already gone by now. You're in a smaller group than you think."
  ],
  "long_term": [
    "At this point, the research suggests your habit is transitioning from 'effortful' to 'automatic.' You might notice some days you do it without even thinking about it. That's the goal.",
    "30+ days. This is no longer an experiment — it's part of your life now. The neural pathway is well-worn. Protect it, but also know that it's getting more resilient every day.",
    "Here's something interesting: people who maintain habits long-term report that the habit itself becomes the reward. It stops being 'something I have to do' and becomes 'something I'd miss if I didn't do.' Watch for that shift.",
    "You've proven something to yourself that no app, book, or motivational speaker could prove for you: you can decide to change a behavior and actually do it. That's transferable to everything.",
    "At this stage, the main risk isn't quitting — it's disruption. Travel, illness, life changes. Have a plan for those. What's the minimum viable version of this habit when everything else falls apart?",
    "Your consistency is now a data point your brain uses for identity. 'I'm someone who does this.' That's the most powerful force in habit psychology — identity-based habits outlast goal-based ones.",
    "Consider leveling up slightly. Not dramatically — just enough to keep growth happening. Add 5 minutes. One more rep. A slightly harder version. Stagnation and boredom are the enemies now.",
    "You don't need this advice anymore. But here's some anyway: the fact that you're still checking in after 30+ days means the system is working. Trust it."
  ],
  "breaking_bad_early": [
    "Breaking a habit is neurologically harder than building one. You're not just creating a new pathway — you're fighting an existing one. Be patient with yourself.",
    "The urge to do the thing you're quitting will come in waves. They peak and pass, usually within 10-15 minutes. If you can ride it out, the wave subsides. Every wave you survive weakens the next one.",
    "Identify your triggers. Every bad habit has a cue — a time, place, emotion, or preceding action that kicks off the behavior. You can't fight what you can't see.",
    "Replacement is more effective than elimination. Don't just stop doing the thing — replace it with something else that satisfies the same underlying need. Doomscrolling fills a need for stimulation. What else could fill it?",
    "Tell yourself 'not right now' instead of 'never again.' Your brain panics at permanent restriction. 'Not right now' is manageable. String enough of those together and you've broken the habit.",
    "Remove friction from the right choice, add friction to the wrong one. Want to stop late-night scrolling? Charge your phone in another room. The 30 seconds of effort to go get it is often enough.",
    "Expect the first 72 hours to be the hardest. After that, the acute withdrawal of the dopamine loop starts to fade. You're in the hardest part right now.",
    "You're not 'giving something up.' You're gaining something: control, time, health, freedom. Frame it as an addition, not a subtraction."
  ],
  "breaking_bad_urge": [
    "Feeling the pull right now? That's your basal ganglia — the habit center of your brain — sending a signal. It's automated and unconscious. Recognizing it as a signal, not a command, is half the battle.",
    "The 'urge surfing' technique: instead of fighting the urge, observe it. Where do you feel it in your body? How intense is it on a 1-10 scale? Just watching it with curiosity tends to reduce its power.",
    "Each time you feel the urge and don't act on it, you're weakening the neural pathway. It doesn't feel like progress, but it is. The pathway is literally decaying from disuse.",
    "If you caved today, the worst thing you can do is binge on it. One slip is recoverable. A full relapse is much harder to come back from. Limit the damage and reset tomorrow.",
    "High-risk times for bad habits: when you're tired, hungry, lonely, stressed, or bored (the HALT-B framework). If you're feeling any of these, address that need first. The urge may disappear on its own.",
    "Change your environment during high-risk windows. If evenings are your danger zone, be somewhere different. Go for a walk. Call someone. Physical environment change disrupts the cue-routine loop."
